### Epilogue
| Hello, this is Piyaphat Liamwilai. The programmer of this team or Gemini! We have decided to publicize this team's source code because we value the development of this competition and truly believe that this competition shouldn't always be about winning, it should be about the friends that we have made throughout this competition or the learning experiences that we have got from our time in the MakeX competition. I hope that this repository or some of my code have provide you with some benefits. I tried my best to make the code as easy to read as possible so please have some fun with it. While our run have come to an ended due to an unfortunate circumstances, I won't cry about it. I believe that both me and my alliance have tried our best to play and this is the best ranking we have possibly gotten. If you have any problems or trouble with the code, you can always ask me by discord or instagram. My discord is **"noat."** Now let's meet again next year, hopefully in a year where this competition have developed much more.
